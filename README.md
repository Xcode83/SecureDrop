**A cutting-edge, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application built with modern web technologies.**

SecureDrop allows you to transfer files of any size directly from your device to another, completely bypassing server uploads. Your data remains private, secure, and is never stored anywhere in the cloud.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Technology Explained

Traditional file sharing requires uploading a file to a central server, which then allows others to download it. This creates privacy risks and potential bottlenecks.

SecureDrop avoids this entirely by using **WebRTC** (Web Real-Time Communication), a powerful API built directly into modern browsers.

1.  **Signaling:** The sender initiates a session and receives a unique ID from a public PeerJS signaling server. This server's only job is to introduce two peers to each other.
2.  **Handshake:** The receiver uses this ID (via the shared link or QR code) to signal their presence to the sender.
3.  **Direct Connection:** Once the handshake is complete, the signaling server's job is done. A direct, encrypted peer-to-peer connection is established between the two browsers.
4.  **Data Transfer:** The file is broken into chunks and streamed directly from the sender's browser to the receiver's browser. The data never passes through any other server.
